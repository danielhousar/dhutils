*********** libdanh **********

Libdanh is general purpose C library with some functions

If you wonder, why so egoistic name of library: there wasn't better name.
If you like this library, but you dont't like the name of library, email me and I'll rename it.

The library is licensed under GPL.

You can copy, modify and what you want to do with code or binaries of this library.

This README was written because someone required README file. It is written fast. I like writing of code, not READMEs.

If you have some questions or issues with compilling or something else, just email me: daniel.h.080490.cs@gmail.com

 - talking about code is better than writing and reading borring READMEs.
